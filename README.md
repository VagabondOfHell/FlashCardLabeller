Quick Study Tool

Created this to help my fiance study for her own tests. As I was in the middle of my capstone project, 
I only allowed myself 8 hours in one day to accomplish this. While it is missing some nice-to-have 
functionalities such as Edit and Delete, and a better User Interface, it served its purpose while
she was in school. The code is also a bit messy, as much of the functionality is placed directly
inside the Windows Form rather than being in its own class.
